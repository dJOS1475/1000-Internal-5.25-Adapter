Tandy 1000 Internal 5.25 FDD Adapter

This Tandy 1000 Internal Floppy Drive Adapter allows you to install a 5.25" Floppy Drive in Tandy 1000's that send power over the Floppy cable. This adapter removes the power from the floppy cable so you don't destroy your precious floppy drive. Tandy used to notch the 5.25" section of their floppy cables to prevent this but many of the cables have been replaced due to failure.

Tandy 1000's that have power supplied via the Floppy Cable include the HX, SL/2, TX, TL, TL/2, TL/3.

All you need is a compatible Standard 360kb DSDD 5.25" Floppy Drive. Disk drive power is supplied from your Tandy power supply.

I made these because many folks want to replace a dead Floppy Drive in their Tandy 1000's but due to the non-standard power-over-cable-design were unable to find a compatible replacement drive.
